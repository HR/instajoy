# Development

Structure:
- `master` - production staging branch (with tagged releases)
- `dev` - main development branch
- `{YOUR_NAME}/{ISSUE}-{FEATURE_NAME}` - feature branch

You should work on your feature branch until you have implemented it at which point you land it onto `dev` via a merge or, preferably, a rebase. Once `dev` is release-ready it is landed onto `master`.
